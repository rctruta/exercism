# Exercism Learning Tracks

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions and learning progress across various programming language tracks on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org). Exercism is an online platform that provides coding exercises and mentorship to help developers improve their skills in specific languages.

My journey on Exercism began during the COVID-19 lockdown, and it has since become an invaluable resource for hands-on practice, learning idiomatic language features, and embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Languages and Key Learnings

This repository contains my solutions for the following language tracks:

### Go
* **Focus:** Concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels), error handling, interfaces, and idiomatic Go programming.
* **Status:** Completed `X` exercises (e.g., "all core exercises," or "many exercises focusing on...").
* [Link to my Go solutions directory in this repo](e.g., `./go`)

### Haskell
* **Focus:** Functional programming paradigms, immutability, type systems, and recursion.
* **Status:** Explored foundational concepts and solved `X` exercises.
* [Link to my Haskell solutions directory in this repo](e.g., `./haskell`)

### Rust
* **Focus:** Ownership model, borrowing, lifetimes, memory safety, and concurrent programming.
* **Status:** Explored core concepts and solved `X` exercises.
* [Link to my Rust solutions directory in this repo](e.g., `./rust`)

### Python (Practice)
* **Focus:** Deepening understanding of advanced Python features, optimizing solutions, and practicing clean code principles.
* **Status:** Extensive practice with `X` exercises completed.
* [Link to my Python solutions directory in this repo](e.g., `./python`)

### Other Explorations (e.g., Julia, Scala)
* Briefly explored `X` exercises in languages like Julia and Scala to understand different programming paradigms and expand my knowledge base.
* [Link to other solutions directory in this repo](e.g., `./other`)

## How to Explore

Each language track typically has its own directory containing solutions to various exercises. You can navigate through these directories to view the code.

## Why Exercism?

Exercism has proven to be an excellent platform for:
* **Hands-on Learning:** Directly applying language concepts through practical problems.
* **Test-Driven Development:** Encouraging a robust approach to coding by writing tests first.
* **Idiomatic Practice:** Learning the best practices and common patterns for each language.
* **Community & Mentorship:** Benefiting from feedback on submitted solutions (if you engaged with mentorship).
