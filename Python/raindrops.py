    Convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.

    has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
    has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.
